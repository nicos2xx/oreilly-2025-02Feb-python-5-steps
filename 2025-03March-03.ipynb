    "\n",
    "I've already said that functions (and methods) are the verbs in a programming language. When we want our program to do something, we invoke a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want the computer to do new things that are specific to our interests/projects, do we need to write functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: No!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want, we can use only the builtin functions to do whatever we want. But that's a bad idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DRY (don't repeat yourself) rule -- if we have the same functionality in several places, we can write a function and then call it in each of those places. If/when the function then needs fine-tuning, debugging, improvements, etc., we can modify it in one place, and those modifications will affect all of the invocations\n",
    "- We can think at a higher level -- rather than thinking about many very small actions, we can write a function and then think of it as a larger, higher-level action. This is known as *abstraction*. We don't think about the small stuff, but give it a name and think about the larger container.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that a function gives one (new) name to a variety of actions that we could have listed one at a time."

    "# How can we write our own function?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use the keyword `def` (\"define\") to start a function definition.\n",
    "- Then we name the function we want to write. This name should follow the same rules as all Python variables -- all lowercase, using `_` between words, and make it appropriate for the task it'll do\n",
    "- Then we have (for now) empty `()`\n",
    "- At the end of the (first) line, we have `:`\n",
    "- Following that, we have an indented \"function body,\" the stuff that will execute every time we call the function. The function body can contain any Python code we want -- `if`, `for`, `input`, `print`, etc.\n",
    "- The function body doesn't execute when we define the function! Rather, it executes when we invoke the function."

    "\n",
    "Because `def` defines a variable (just like `=`, but for functions), this means that you **cannot** in Python have a variable and a function with the same name. It would be like having to variables named `x`; if you do that, then the latter one to be defined is still active/available.\n",
