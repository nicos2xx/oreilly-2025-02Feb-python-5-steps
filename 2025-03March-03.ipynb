    "I've already said that functions (and methods) are the verbs in a programming language. When we want our program to do something, we invoke a function.\n",

    "If we want the computer to do new things that are specific to our interests/projects, do we need to write functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: No!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want, we can use only the builtin functions to do whatever we want. But that's a bad idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DRY (don't repeat yourself) rule -- if we have the same functionality in several places, we can write a function and then call it in each of those places. If/when the function then needs fine-tuning, debugging, improvements, etc., we can modify it in one place, and those modifications will affect all of the invocations\n",
    "- We can think at a higher level -- rather than thinking about many very small actions, we can write a function and then think of it as a larger, higher-level action. This is known as *abstraction*. We don't think about the small stuff, but give it a name and think about the larger container."
